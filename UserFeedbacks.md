## Conversation for getting search params

### Santrax

- He needs a way to change a response after sending it, cuz it may happen that the moment the message is sent he will change his mind or notice that he made a mistake.
- Before starting the module for getting search params he wants to have an idea of the module lenght and what questions will be asked.
- Some questions are misleading, for example terrace and balcony for him are almost the same thing
- Bathrooms question should be "Minimum bathrooms number" instead
- For yes or now answers it would be nice to have an emoji for example a check mark and an x button
- while in searching mode it would be nice to have a stop button.

### francesco_snt

- While in searchin mode it would be nice to have a stop button for panic.

### Akalala

- For him it would be better to stick with only one way to get user data, for example if we get them with text then every question should ask user to type, otherwise if we use buttons then everything should be buttons
- For example for the location would be nice to have a map to input it.

### Waffo
